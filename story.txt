While perusing the contents of the memoranda source code, I had a kopfkino about relaxing at the beach with my family.
In the heat of the moment, I decided to drive to the airport and take a flight to florida so I could go to the beach, not realizng it's a Schnapsidee idea, since it's hurricane season now! All flights were delayed because of the weather, so I decided to grab a drink in the local ratskeller. The next day, I decided to go to the flughafen again to book a flight. Many other people were racing to the desk in order to book a flight, people were shoving and pushing each other to get to the frong, it was very wettbewerbsfaehig.
