While perusing the contents of the memoranda source code, I had a kopfkino about relaxing at the beach with my family.
In the heat of the moment, I decided to drive to the airport and take a flight to florida so I could go to the beach, not realizng it's a Schnapsidee idea, since it's hurricane season now! 
All flights were delayed because of the weather, so I decided to grab a drink in the local ratskeller. 
The next day, I decided to go to the flughafen again to book a flight. 
Many other people were racing to the desk in order to book a flight, people were shoving and pushing each other to get to the front, it was very wettbewerbsfaehig.
What was worse was that it was the middle of summer and the airport's klimaanlage was broken. 
This experience became a little more bearable when I discovered a shop in the airport selling fresh brot and lemonade.
Out of exhaustion, I accidently spilled the lemonade all over myself. I was wearing Lederhose and I had to leave the shop embarrassed, making weird sqeeky sound while walking through the busy airport.
At the ticket desk I met a porky man who looked like he would crush the chair he was sitting on at any moment. "Too many bratwurst for him" I thought.
