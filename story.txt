While perusing the contents of the memoranda source code, I had a kopfkino about relaxing at the beach with my family.
In the heat of the moment, I decided to drive to the airport and take a flight to florida so I could go to the beach, not realizng it's a Schnapsidee idea, since it's hurricane season now!
