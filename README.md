# StoryTime
Icebreaker part 1. We each take turns adding sentences to a story using german words. 

Each person should write a sentence in a story using one of the german words. 
The sentences have to be appended to the currently existing story. When you use
a german word in a sentence, define/translate it in the dictionary.txt file.
Everyone should check in on this at least twice, and in total add at least 2 sentences.
